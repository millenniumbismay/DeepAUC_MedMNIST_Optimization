# DeepAUC_MedMNIST_Optimization
This project aims to improve the generalization ability of DAM for medical image classification tasks. To improve the benchmark performance reported in the MedMNIST paper. For fair comparison, we used the same network structure as in the MedMNIST paper i.e. Resnet-18(28).
